Hello, my name is Luca and this is my blog, where I post about the things that
interest me.
I have a Master&rsquo;s degree in Cellular and Molecular Biology, and I specialize in
Bioinformatics. I live in Turin, Italy.
I&rsquo;m currently working as a PHD candidate at Prof. Munaron Lab, under the supervision of Dr. Ruffinatti at the University of Turin.
The goal of my PhD is to profile the gene expression in tumor cells to detect deregulations at a whole-transportome level."><meta property="og:image" content><meta property="og:url" content="https://mrhedmad.github.io/blog/about/"><meta property="og:site_name" content="Open Bytes"><meta property="og:title" content="About"><meta property="og:description" content="Hello, my name is Luca and this is my blog, where I post about the things that interest me.

interest me.</p><p>I have a Master&rsquo;s degree in Cellular and Molecular Biology, and I specialize in
Bioinformatics. I live in Turin, Italy.
I&rsquo;m currently working as a PHD candidate at Prof. Munaron Lab, under the supervision of Dr. Ruffinatti at the University of Turin.
The goal of my PhD is to profile the gene expression in tumor cells to detect deregulations at a whole-transportome level.</p><p>I mostly code in <code>R</code> and <code>Python</code>, although I&rsquo;ve recently taken a liking for the
<code>Rust</code> programming language.</p><p>Contact me with my email: <code>luca.visentin (at) unito.it</code></p><p>In my spare time I&rsquo;m a PC gamer, and I play a ton of board games and (occasionally) Dungeons and Dragons.</p><p>You can find <a href=https://linktr.ee/mrhedmad>my linktree here</a>.

There is a post somewhere here that details
what I use on my personal laptop.
Arch is just leagues better than other flavours of Linux thanks to <code>pacman</code>
and the official and unofficial repositories. Being a rolling release is also
a must for me. I think my old Ubuntu systems broke at every release update.</p></li><li><p><a href=https://neovim.io/>NeoVim</a></p><p>I&rsquo;ve been using NeoVim for a long time now, and I think I won&rsquo;t ever go back.
It excels at both speed and convenience.</p></li><li><p><a href=https://www.rstudio.com/>RStudio</a></p><p>To edit R source there is little better than RStudio. RStudio server can also
be installed on a remote machine to let you work remotely from the desktop. It
is not the best IDE, but the best when it comes to R.</p></li><li><p><a href=https://github.com/foostan/crkbd>The Corne keyboard</a></p><p>After I bought this keyboard I cannot go back to anything else. It is
expensive, looks amazing, a hell to put together, can be configured to your
liking and grabs everyone&rsquo;s attention when they walk in the lab.
The keys are <a href=https://deskthority.net/wiki/Cherry_MX_White>Cherry Whites</a>
with blank white keycaps (to force me to <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touch_typing>touch type</a>).
It is programmed with <a href=https://caniusevia.com/><code>via</code></a>, so it sends the
canonical <code>en-US</code> keycodes but with the <a href=https://sites.google.com/alanreiser.com/handsdown/home>Hands Down Reference</a>
layout.</p><p>I like to think of myself as a keyboard goblin.</p></li><li><p><a href=https://www.apple.com/ipad-pro/>An Ipad Pro</a></p><p>I got an ipad as a gift from me (and my SO) for the start of my PhD course at the university of Turin.</p><p>I have access to an intel NUC at the lab, and my PC at home, so the ipad is what gets carried back and forth from home to the lab, daily. Its capabilities to markup text and take notes are unsurpassed, and is a hub for all of my documents and things to read.</p></li></ul><h2 id=about-this-blog>About this blog</h2><p>I try to post about things that I like, or concepts that are not well explained
on the internet. Many posts here are mainly my notes on some topic or other, for my future reference.

This is my very unserious blog, where I discuss topics anywhere in the seriousness spectrum.\
I mostly talk about open science or data stewardship or academic programming or bioinformatics, though.
Feel free to hang around.

You can access all posts via the 'Posts' button above.
Since I'm nice, I've also moved it down here, for your convenience.
Don't have to thank me: [Posts](posts/)

If, for some obscure reason, you are interested in who I am, [~~it's none of your business~~](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jtXX3aAPPwg) you can find my other links and my about page [here](https://hedmad.eu).

&lt;p>The reasons for this should be obvious for anyone vaguely reading the news: threats of fascism rising again should scare anyone away from any large data-gathering entity, especially if it is as pervasive as Google is.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>It has been scary to notice how reliant I am on Google services: I use Google search to move around the web, Google maps to move around in real life, Gmail as both my work&lt;sup id="fnref:1">&lt;a href="#fn:1" class="footnote-ref" role="doc-noteref">1&lt;/a>&lt;/sup> and personal email addresses, Google&amp;rsquo;s YouTube as one of my main sources of entertainment, use an Android phone relying on the Google App store to bring me apps and updates, and use my Google account on a ton of other services.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>About</title><link>blog.hedmad.eu/about/</link><pubDate>Fri, 07 Feb 2025 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>blog.hedmad.eu/about/</guid><description>&lt;img src="blog.hedmad.eu/blog/resources/images/profile.png" alt="My Dumb Face" class="right" style="border-radius: 8px; width: 200px; float: right; border:10px solid transparent;" />


&lt;p>Hello, my name is Luca and this is my blog, where I occasionally post about the things that
interest me.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;ve had a keen interest in things that are alive, and have studied biology all my life.
I have a Master&amp;rsquo;s degree in Cellular and Molecular Biology, and have combined my interest in biology with my passion for computer science late in my Master Degree course, so now I work as a Bioinformatician.
I am based in Turin, Italy.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Future Open Research</title><link>blog.hedmad.eu/posts/future_research/</link><pubDate>Fri, 25 Oct 2024 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>blog.hedmad.eu/posts/future_research/</guid><description>&lt;p>In this piece, I hope to give an overall view of how I believe the future research &amp;ldquo;flow&amp;rdquo; should look like, given the ideas in the Open Science and FAIR spaces, and how data stewards fit into the overall picture.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>I&amp;rsquo;d like to place a disclaimer here. I am, in no shape or form, thinking that the ideas presented here would be easy to implement. However, I believe that delineating and keeping in mind the &lt;em>golden standard&lt;/em> is essential while pursuing it.
These ideas also apply to &lt;em>publicly funded&lt;/em> research. Privately funded research might not fit this schema, although I&amp;rsquo;d argue many aspects can be transversal.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>On two-dimensional qualitative LMs for gene expression analysis</title><link>blog.hedmad.eu/posts/on_2d_lm_deas/</link><pubDate>Thu, 16 Feb 2023 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>blog.hedmad.eu/posts/on_2d_lm_deas/</guid><description>&lt;p>When dealing with differential gene expression analyses (DEAs), one can often
come across a difficulty of interpreting the linear models that are used to
detect differentially expressed genes, especially when more than one
experimental variable is considered.&lt;/p>
&lt;p>Both the &lt;code>limma&lt;/code> and &lt;code>DESeq2&lt;/code> packages are very famous packages for running DEAs. They both
use linear models (LMs) - generalized linear models (GLMs) for &lt;code>DESeq2&lt;/code>- to
model the expression of every gene across all considered conditions, and use
the associated p-values and beta coefficients of the resulting models to detect
DEGs.&lt;/p></description></item><item><title>Arch Linux Installation</title><link>blog.hedmad.eu/posts/archinstall/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>blog.hedmad.eu/posts/archinstall/</guid><description>&lt;p>These are my short notes on installing Arch on my laptop (an Asus Zenbook 14).
It has UEFI Boot and a single hard disk of 500Gb. It has an Italian keyboard
(&lt;code>it&lt;/code>), a NVIDIA card and an Intel processor.&lt;/p>

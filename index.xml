Both the limma and DESeq2 packages are very famous packages for running DEAs. They both use linear models (LMs) - generalized linear models (GLMs) for DESeq2- to model the expression of every gene across all considered conditions, and use the associated p-values and beta coefficients of the resulting models to detect DEGs.</description></item><item><title>Arch Installation</title><link>https://mrhedmad.github.io/blog/posts/archinstall/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mrhedmad.github.io/blog/posts/archinstall/</guid><description>Installing Arch linux These are my short notes on installing Arch on my laptop (an Asus Zenbook 14). It has UEFI Boot and a single hard disk of 500Gb. It has an Italian keyboard (it), a NVIDIA card and an Intel processor.
Mandatory disclaimer: Do not follow this guide. Follow the real guide over in the Arch wiki.
Get an installation ISO Download from www.archlinux.org/download/ the latest ISO and ask a friend with windows to use Rufus to make a bootable USB stick with it.</description></item><item><title>About</title><link>https://mrhedmad.github.io/blog/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mrhedmad.github.io/blog/about/</guid><description>Hello, my name is Luca and this is my blog, where I post about the things that interest me.
I have a Master&amp;rsquo;s degree in Cellular and Molecular Biology, and I specialize in Bioinformatics. I live in Turin, Italy. I&amp;rsquo;m currently working as a PHD candidate at Prof. Munaron Lab, under the supervision of Dr. Ruffinatti at the University of Turin. The goal of my PhD is to profile the gene expression in tumor cells to detect deregulations at a whole-transportome level.</description></item><item><title>Archive</title><link>https://mrhedmad.github.io/blog/archive/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mrhedmad.github.io/blog/archive/</guid><description/></item></channel></rss>

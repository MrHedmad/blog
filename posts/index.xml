Both the limma and DESeq2 packages are very famous packages for running DEAs. They both use linear models (LMs) - generalized linear models (GLMs) for DESeq2- to model the expression of every gene across all considered conditions, and use the associated p-values and beta coefficients of the resulting models to detect DEGs.</description></item><item><title>Arch Linux Installation</title><link>https://mrhedmad.github.io/blog/posts/archinstall/</link><pubDate>Sun, 10 Apr 2022 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://mrhedmad.github.io/blog/posts/archinstall/</guid><description>Installing Arch linux These are my short notes on installing Arch on my laptop (an Asus Zenbook 14). It has UEFI Boot and a single hard disk of 500Gb. It has an Italian keyboard (it), a NVIDIA card and an Intel processor.
Mandatory disclaimer: Do not follow this guide. Follow the real guide over in the Arch wiki.
Get an installation ISO Download from www.archlinux.org/download/ the latest ISO and ask a friend with windows to use Rufus to make a bootable USB stick with it.</description></item></channel></rss>
